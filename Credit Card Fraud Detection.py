# ### Data Source:
#  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023?select=creditcard_2023.csv
#  - The dataset was collected from credit card transactions made by European cardholders in 2023, with sensitive information removed to ensure privacy and compliance with ethical guidelines.

# ### Business Problem: 
# Credit card fraud is a significant challenge for financial institutions worldwide, costing the industry billions of dollars annually. Fraudulent transactions not only result in financial losses but also erode customer trust and increase operational costs for banks and credit card companies. The problem at hand involves detecting fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset. The goal is to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate based on various features (such as transaction amount, user behavior, and transaction type). This classification is crucial because fraud detection is a high-priority task for businesses in the financial sector, as it helps to prevent significant financial losses and protect customers.
# 
# ### Current Challenges:
# The challenge lies in classifying the minority class (fraudulent transactions), which is often underrepresented in the dataset, leading to potential issues with model performance (such as poor recall for fraud detection)
# High Volume of Transactions: Millions of transactions occur daily, making it difficult to manually detect fraudulent activity. Customer Experience: Overzealous fraud detection systems may flag legitimate transactions, causing inconvenience to customers and potential loss of business.
# 
# ### Objective:
# The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to accurately detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, minimizing financial losses and maintaining customer satisfaction.

# ### Solution Method
# To tackle this problem the solution was broken down into several key steps:
# 
#  - Data Preprocessing:
#         Checked for missing and duplicate values
#         Checked for Imbalanced Classes
#         Scaled numeric feature: The Amount feature was scaled using StandardScaler to normalize its values, ensuring that the model isn't biased by differences in feature magnitudes.
#         
#  - Model Selection:
#     I compared the performance of three different models: Random Forest Classifier: Chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships, and effectiveness with imbalanced datasets. Logistic Regression: A simpler, linear model used to set a baseline for comparison. Decision Tree Classifier: Chosen for its interpretability and ability to handle non-linear relationships. After training and evaluation, the Random Forest model outperformed the other models in terms of precision, recall, and f1-score, making it the best choice for this problem.
#     
#  - Hyperparameter Tuning:
#     I used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest model, which were max_depth=20, min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=5, and n_estimators=200. This step ensured that we obtained the most optimal configuration for the model.
#  
#  - Regularization: Integrated regularization techniques into the Random Forest model.In this model, regularization is achieved through structural constraints which aims to regulate the growth of decision trees, making them less likely to overfit the training data.
#  
#  - Feature Engineering: Add Interaction Terms: Create new features as combinations of the top features.
#     
#  - Model Evaluation:
#    I evaluated the models on both training and test datasets. Key performance metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy were calculated. Confusion matrix and ROC curve were also used to visualize performance and check how well the model discriminates between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
#    
#  - Test Error Analysis: I analyzed misclassified instances to gain insights into potential edge cases or patterns where the model struggled, which could help in refining the model further.
# 
#  - Deployability:
#     The model was wrapped in a pipeline to ensure consistent preprocessing during training and prediction. This pipeline was saved using joblib for easy deployment in production environments.

# ### Results
# The Random Forest model achieved excellent performance on both the training and test sets. The precision, recall, and f1-score values were near-perfect, especially for the fraud class (1), demonstrating the model's ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions.
#    - Test Set Performance:
#      -  Accuracy Score:98.7%
# 
#      - F1 Score:98.7%
# 
#      - Recall_score:97.7%
# 
#      - Precision_score:99.7%

# ### Business Impact
# 
#  - Reduction of Financial Losses: With a precision of 99.87% and a recall of 97.29%, the model is highly effective in identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing the risk of false positives. This helps businesses reduce financial losses due to fraud. 
#  - Customer Trust: By identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time, financial institutions can protect their customers, prevent unauthorized transactions, and maintain customer trust.
#  - Operational Efficiency: The model can be deployed in a production environment to automate fraud detection, reducing the need for manual checks and improving operational efficiency.
#  - Scalability: The solution is scalable and can be applied to large datasets, making it suitable for deployment in any financial institution handling a significant volume of transactions.

# ### Feature description:       
#    - id: Unique identifier for each transaction
#    - V1-V28: Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)
#    - Amount: The transaction amount
#    - Class: Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)

# ### Data Preprocessing
# 
# - Goal: Prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling by handling irrelevant data, missing values,duplicate values and scaling.
# 
#    - Drop the id column as it does not provide information relevant to fraud detection.
#    - Verify that the dataset has no missing values.
#    - Scale the Amount column to normalize the range of values, ensuring all features contribute equally to the model.

# ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# 
#  - Goal: Gain insights into the data and detect imbalances or patterns.

# ### Check for Class Imbalance

#  - Goal: Balance the dataset to improve model performance on the minority class (fraud cases).
# 
#    - Use the SMOTE technique to oversample the minority class, ensuring the dataset has equal representation of fraud and non-fraud cases.

# ### handling overfitting with regularization
# In this model, regularization is achieved through structural constraints:
# 
#  -   max_depth: Limits tree depth to prevent overly complex splits.
#  -   min_samples_split: Ensures nodes are split only if they have enough data.
#  - min_samples_leaf: Prevents leaves with very few samples.
#  -   max_features: Reduces the number of features considered at each split, increasing randomness and reducing overfitting.
#  -   class_weight='balanced': Adjusts class weights to handle imbalanced datasets.
# 
# These constraints regulate the growth of decision trees, making them less likely to overfit the training data.

# ### Misclassified Instances:
# The model predominantly misclassifies instances where the actual class is 1 (fraudulent) but predicts it as 0 (non-fraudulent). This suggests that these cases might lie closer to the decision boundary or exhibit patterns similar to non-fraudulent transactions.
# 
# ### Steps to improve model:
#  - plot feature importance and use top 3 features for further analysis:
#    - distrubutions of features

#    - error analysis with top features
#    - feature engineer using top 3 features

# ### Conclusion
# 
# This project successfully addressed the challenge of fraud detection by using a Random Forest Classifier. By applying careful data preprocessing, model tuning, and regularization, I developed a robust model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall. The solution has tangible business benefits, including reducing financial losses, protecting customers, and improving operational efficiency. The model is also deployable in a production environment and can be easily maintained and updated as needed.
# 
# While Logistic Regression and Decision Trees were also explored, the Random Forest model emerged as the most effective approach for the given problem. Future steps could involve exploring more advanced techniques (such as ensemble methods, boosting, or deep learning) and incorporating additional features to further improve the model's performance.
